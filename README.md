# autonomous car in real time road detection simulation with 
This is source code of the part of my research project in ISAE SUPAERO master program. The final goal of the code is to simulate the auto pilot behaviours of autonomous vehicle by considering pictures capturing by front camera as inputs and steering command as ouput. In this project, I explore a transformative approach - converting manual cars into autonomous ones, paving the way for an eco-friendly transportation ecosystem. The key focus areas are visual perception and motion planning, tackling the challenges of end-to-end self-driving systems.For image semantic segmentation, I apply Unet convolutional neural network model that outperforms previous models carried out by my project successor, achieving exceptional Intersection over Union scores. The implementation of image filtering techniques plays a crucial role in streamlining computational resources while maintaining high-quality results. In the realm of motion planning, we leverage a dataset comprising video and steering commands from the control wheel. This data trains a neural network model to mimic human driving behavior. This unique combination of convolutional and fully connected neural networks yields remarkable results, albeit with minor discrepancies in certain frames that don't significantly impact vehicle behavior.

# intro
The goal of this project is to predict the steering command of the autonomous vehicle based on the camera sensor.
